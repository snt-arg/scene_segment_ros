# Scene Segmenter

A framework for real-time segmentation of given images (video frames) based on the given parameters and configurations. The main use case of this repository is to be used in [vS-Graphs](https://github.com/snt-arg/visual_sgraphs), where the camera output seen by the robot is sent to the current package to be segmented.

## 📝 Prerequisites

The required libraries ...

## 📚 Preparation

### I. Cloning

Create a new workspace and clone the repo in its `src` folder. In case the repository is going to be used for `vS-Graphs`, it is recommended to clone the repository in the same `src` folder where it exists, as `vS-Graphs` depends on it. Accordingly, you can use the command below:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:snt-arg/scene_segment_ros.git
```

After cloning the repository, you may add a command like `alias sourcecsr='source ~/workspace/[PATH]/devel/setup.bash'` in your `.bashrc` file.

### II. Installing Python Libraries

Install the required `Python` libraries for running this program using the command below:

```
pip install -r src/requirements.txt
```

## 📅 TODO

- Finding a realtime Semantic Segmentation framework
  - Benchmarking and comparing
- Merging it with ROS-based ORB-SLAM for mapping
- Testing with a robot
